# The Github Finder Application

This web-app uses the [Github Rest API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest) to build a Github user lookup and information site.

## Code base

- The React.js framework is used for this project 
- Tailwind and the Daisy UI plugin for styling (see index.html) 
- Tailwind offers utility classes instead of components, so allows you to be pretty flexible with your styling and not much plain CSS was used.

## Github API token 

The REACT_APP_GITHUB_TOKEN in the .env file may expire. if that happens, request a new one and assign it as a string to REACT_APP_GITHUB_TOKEN.
